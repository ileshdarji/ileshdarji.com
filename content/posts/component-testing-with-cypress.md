Cypress is well known for its end-to-end testing capabilities, but it also supports **component testing** — a powerful way to test individual UI components in isolation.

Whether you're working with React, Vue, or other modern frameworks, component testing helps you:

- 🚀 Validate components faster
- 🧪 Get real browser feedback instantly
- 🔄 Test props, slots, events, and more

---

## 🧰 What is Cypress Component Testing?

Component testing means rendering a single component in a real browser and asserting its behavior and appearance — without loading the full app or routing.

It’s like unit testing with superpowers.

---

## 🔧 Setup Cypress for Component Testing (React Example)

First, install required dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev cypress @cypress/react @cypress/webpack-dev-server
```

Then in `cypress.config.js`, enable the component testing config:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'cypress'

export default defineConfig({
  component: {
    devServer: {
      framework: 'react',
      bundler: 'webpack'
    }
  }
})
```

Now create a component test:

```bash
mkdir -p cypress/component
touch cypress/component/Button.cy.jsx
```

---

## ✍️ Example: Testing a React Button

```jsx
import Button from '../../src/components/Button'

describe('Button component', () => {
  it('renders with text and handles click', () => {
    cy.mount(<Button onClick={() => alert('clicked')}>Click Me</Button>)
    cy.contains('Click Me').click()
  })
})
```

You can use `cy.mount()` to render the component just like in a unit test, but with the real DOM and styles.

---

## 🧪 Vue Support Too!

For Vue apps:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @cypress/vue
```

Update the config to use `framework: 'vue'`.

---

## 🎯 When to Use Component Testing

- Isolated validation of UI components
- Before merging component changes
- For design system/Storybook integration
- Faster test feedback vs full E2E

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Write one test file per component
- Cover visual state, props, interaction
- Use real DOM to test CSS/styling
- Combine with Storybook for consistency

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

Cypress component testing brings together the speed of unit tests and the realism of browser-based rendering. It's ideal for teams using React or Vue who want tight feedback loops and reliable, framework-aware tests.
