### Introduction
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a process used in data engineering to extract raw data from multiple sources, transform it according to business rules, and load it into a target database or data warehouse.

ETL testing ensures that:
- Data is accurately extracted from the source.
- Transformations follow business rules correctly.
- Data is loaded correctly into the destination without loss or corruption.

This process is crucial for data quality and ensures that reports, dashboards, and machine learning models rely on clean and accurate data.

## Key ETL Testing Concepts

### Extract Testing
- Validate whether data is extracted correctly from the source (e.g., databases, APIs, CSV files).
- Ensure no missing records or incorrect data types.

### Transform Testing
- Verify that business rules, aggregations, and joins are applied correctly.
- Example: If sales tax is 10%, ensure all records reflect `price * 1.10` correctly.

### Load Testing
- Confirm that data is correctly inserted into the target database.
- Ensure referential integrity (e.g., Foreign Key relationships are maintained).

## Types of ETL Testing
| Type of ETL Testing       | Purpose |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Data Completeness      | Ensures all records are extracted and loaded. |
| Data Transformation    | Validates business logic and data processing. |
| Data Integrity         | Checks for duplicate, missing, or corrupted data. |
| Performance Testing    | Tests ETL speed with large datasets. |
| Incremental Load       | Ensures only new and updated records are processed. |

## Tools Used in ETL Testing

### Manual Testing
- SQL Queries (SELECT COUNT(*), JOIN validations)
- Python Scripts (Pandas for data validation)

### Automated Testing
- Great Expectations (Python-based data validation framework)
- dbt (Data Build Tool) (Automated data transformation testing)
- PyTest with Pandas (Automated ETL test cases)

### Cloud-Based ETL Testing
- AWS Glue (for automated ETL workflows)
- Azure Data Factory (for cloud-based data integration)
- Databricks (for big data ETL and testing)

## Sample ETL Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Validate Data Extraction
Run a simple SQL query to check extracted data:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_table;
```
Compare with the destination table:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM target_table;
```
If counts do not match, it means some records are missing during extraction.

### Step 2: Validate Data Transformation
Example: Ensuring that `price` is increased by 10%.
```sql
SELECT id, price, price * 1.10 AS expected_price FROM transformed_table;
```
If `expected_price` does not match the actual data, there is an ETL transformation issue.

### Step 3: Validate Data Load
- Check if foreign key constraints exist.
- Ensure no duplicates using:
```sql
SELECT id, COUNT(*) FROM target_table GROUP BY id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## Conclusion
ETL testing is critical for ensuring that data pipelines deliver clean, accurate, and reliable data. By using SQL, automation tools, and cloud-based testing solutions, teams can build robust ETL workflows.
