+++

For the past 15+ years, I’ve built, tested, and debugged everything from banking systems to cloud-native platforms.  
I’ve worked in high-stakes environments where reliability isn’t optional — it’s the baseline.

But lately, something deeper has been bothering me.

It’s not flaky tests or broken pipelines.  
It’s the fact that we’re heading into a future where we can’t tell what’s human anymore — and no one seems ready for that.

## 🧠 What triggered this

It started small. A fake profile here. A deepfake there. AI-generated blog posts. AI-generated people.

Suddenly, the internet felt… *empty*.  
Content was increasing, but meaning was decreasing.  
Authenticity was being replaced by automation.

And it hit me:

> If we don’t solve **proof of humanity**, everything else we build is at risk —  
> our communities, our conversations, even our sense of self.

## 🔍 Why I care

This isn’t just a technical problem.  
It’s personal.

I’m a father. A son. A volunteer. A human.  
I believe technology should serve people — not replace them, impersonate them, or manipulate them.

And I realized:  
I can’t keep waiting for someone else to build what I believe is missing.

## 🚧 So I started building RealYou

RealYou isn’t just a product. It’s a *principle*:
That your digital presence should belong to you — and you alone.

I’m not here to sell your identity.  
I’m here to protect your dignity.

Without KYC. Without surveillance. Without crypto hype.  
Just a simple, secure, human-first protocol — built with care.

I won’t share every detail yet. It’s early.  
But what I *can* say is: I’m designing it the same way I’ve tested the most critical systems in my career —  
**with edge cases, trust boundaries, and real-world abuse in mind.**

## 🌱 My personal leap

I’m building RealYou not as a side project — but as a purpose-driven mission.

I want to contribute something that actually matters.  
Something that helps people feel safe, seen, and sovereign in a digital world that often erases those things.

I don’t want to just build software.  
I want to help rebuild trust online.

That’s why I’m building RealYou.
