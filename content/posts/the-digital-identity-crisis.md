In a world where bots mimic people, deepfakes pass as truth, and AI-generated content floods our feeds — the internet has a trust problem.

We used to ask, *“Is this real?”*  
Now we ask, *“Is this human?”*

## 🧠 The Problem

Digital identity was never designed for this age.  
Accounts are easy to fake. Faces can be generated. And content can be cloned in seconds.

This isn’t just about social media — it affects hiring, dating, communities, learning, and even democracy.

The tools to create fake content are evolving. But what about tools to **prove authenticity**?

## 🔍 What I'm Exploring

I'm working on something that doesn’t just detect bots — it proves you're **not one**.

A new way to own your digital presence.  
A human-first protocol for the internet.  
Built with privacy, dignity, and security in mind.

## 🧭 Why This Matters

Because as AI gets smarter, *being human online is becoming a feature — not a default.*

If you’ve ever wondered:
- How can I prove I’m real without revealing everything about me?
- How do we protect authenticity in a deepfake world?
- What does a post-truth internet look like — and how do we fix it?

Then you're not alone. I’m asking the same questions — and building toward answers.
