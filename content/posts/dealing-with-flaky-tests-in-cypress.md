Flaky tests are one of the biggest pain points in UI test automation. They pass locally but fail in CI, or fail once and pass on rerun — killing developer confidence and slowing down deployments.

In this post, we’ll dive into **why Cypress tests get flaky**, and how to **fix them using real-world techniques**.

---

## ❗ What Are Flaky Tests?

Flaky tests are tests that fail unpredictably — not because of bugs in the app, but due to:

- Timing issues
- Async delays
- DOM instability
- External API dependencies
- Network latency
- Test pollution (leftover state)

---

## 🔍 Common Causes of Flakiness in Cypress

### 1. **Improper Waiting for Elements**

Bad:

```js
cy.get('.user-card').click()
```

Better:

```js
cy.get('.user-card', { timeout: 10000 }).should('be.visible').click()
```

---

### 2. **Detached DOM Elements**

Sometimes Cypress grabs an element, but it disappears before the action is performed.

Fix:

```js
cy.get('.btn').should('exist').click()
```

Or force a retry:

```js
cy.contains('Submit').click({ force: true })
```

---

### 3. **Non-deterministic Test Data**

Tests that rely on dynamic or random data can cause inconsistent results.

Fix:

- Use fixtures or mocks
- Stub network requests using `cy.intercept()`
- Reset backend state before test runs

---

### 4. **Test Pollution**

Leftover cookies, localStorage, or unclosed modals can affect future tests.

Fix:

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  cy.clearCookies()
  cy.clearLocalStorage()
})
```

## 🛠 How Cypress Helps

- **Built-in retryability** for `.get()`, `.should()`, `.contains()`
- **Time-travel UI** to inspect exact DOM state during failure
- **Custom commands** to encapsulate reliable behavior
- **Network intercepts** to isolate tests from real API flakiness

---

## ✅ Best Practices to Prevent Flaky Tests

- Use `cy.intercept()` to stub unstable APIs
- Prefer `cy.findByRole()` with Testing Library for stable selectors
- Don’t use arbitrary `cy.wait(2000)`
- Add `should('be.visible')` or `should('exist')` before actions
- Always reset test state (`cy.session()`, `cy.clear*()`)

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

Flaky tests erode trust in your automation suite — but they can be fixed.

With Cypress’s built-in power and the right test design, you can build stable, maintainable tests that ship confidently in CI/CD.
