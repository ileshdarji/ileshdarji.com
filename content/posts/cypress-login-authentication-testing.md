Testing login and authentication flows is one of the most critical parts of end-to-end testing. In Cypress, you can validate login behavior through UI interactions, direct API requests, or by injecting authentication tokens for faster tests.

## 🔐 Types of Authentication Testing in Cypress

1. **UI-based Login** – Enter credentials via the login page.
2. **API-based Login** – Authenticate by sending direct requests.
3. **Token Injection** – Manually set tokens in localStorage or cookies.

## 1️⃣ UI-Based Login Test

Simulates real user behavior:

```javascript
describe('UI Login', () => {
  it('logs in through the login form', () => {
    cy.visit('/login')
    cy.get('input[name="email"]').type('user@example.com')
    cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('securepassword')
    cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click()
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard')
  })
})
```

✅ Best for testing frontend form behavior, error messages, validations.

## 2️⃣ API-Based Login Test

Faster and more reliable for backend auth:

```javascript
describe('API Login', () => {
  it('logs in using an API call', () => {
    cy.request('POST', '/api/login', {
      email: 'user@example.com',
      password: 'securepassword'
    }).then((response) => {
      expect(response.status).to.eq(200)
      window.localStorage.setItem('token', response.body.token)
    })
    cy.visit('/dashboard')
  })
})
```

✅ Ideal for bypassing the UI to focus on authenticated functionality.

---

## 3️⃣ Token Injection

Used when tokens are already known or mocked:

```javascript
beforeEach(() => {
  window.localStorage.setItem('token', 'mocked-jwt-token')
})
```

✅ Great for integration testing where the login process is tested separately.

---

## 🧠 Tips for Authentication Testing

- Test both success and failure cases.
- Use fixtures to manage user credentials.
- Keep secrets out of version control — use Cypress environment variables.

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

Whether you're testing login forms or token-based sessions, Cypress offers multiple approaches to simulate authenticated user flows. Use UI login for realism, API login for speed, and token injection for full control.
