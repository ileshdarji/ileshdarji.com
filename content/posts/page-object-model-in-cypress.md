When your Cypress test suite starts growing, managing selectors and test logic becomes difficult. That’s where the **Page Object Model (POM)** comes in — a design pattern that helps organize your test code by separating UI element locators and interactions from actual test steps.

---

## 🧱 What is Page Object Model?

The Page Object Model is a design pattern that:

- Encapsulates selectors and actions for a specific page into a separate file (a "page object").
- Improves **code readability** and **reusability**.
- Makes it easy to update selectors in one place when the UI changes.

## 🗂️ Cypress Folder Structure with POM

Here's an example folder structure:

```
cypress/
├── e2e/
│   └── login.cy.js
├── pages/
│   └── LoginPage.js
```

---

## 📄 Example: `LoginPage.js`

```javascript
export class LoginPage {
  emailInput() {
    return cy.get('input[name="email"]')
  }

  passwordInput() {
    return cy.get('input[name="password"]')
  }

  submitButton() {
    return cy.get('button[type="submit"]')
  }

  login(email, password) {
    this.emailInput().type(email)
    this.passwordInput().type(password)
    this.submitButton().click()
  }
}
```

---

## 🧪 Example: `login.cy.js`

```javascript
import { LoginPage } from '../pages/LoginPage'

describe('Login Test', () => {
  const loginPage = new LoginPage()

  it('should login successfully', () => {
    cy.visit('/login')
    loginPage.login('user@example.com', 'securepassword')
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard')
  })
})
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Keep selectors private inside the page object.
- Group related actions into meaningful methods.
- Use descriptive method names like `loginAsAdmin()` or `fillRegistrationForm()`.

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

Implementing Page Object Model in Cypress helps you:

- Avoid repetitive code
- Keep your test scripts clean and readable
- Maintain large test suites with ease

As your project grows, POM becomes essential for maintainability. Start small, and scale as your app evolves!
