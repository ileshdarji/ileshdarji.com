As your Cypress test suite grows, the execution time can balloon ‚Äî slowing down development feedback and delaying releases. The solution? **Parallel test execution**.

In this guide, you'll learn how to parallelize Cypress tests using the **Cypress Dashboard** and **CI providers like GitHub Actions**.

---

## üöÄ Why Parallelize Cypress Tests?

- ‚úÖ Reduce total test time drastically
- üîÑ Speed up CI/CD pipelines
- üì¶ Increase build throughput for teams
- üîç Spot failing specs faster

---

## üß∞ Prerequisites

- Cypress installed and tests created
- Project connected to the [Cypress Dashboard](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/dashboard/introduction)
- CI setup (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI, GitLab)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step: Enable Parallelization

### 1. **Install Cypress and Set Up Dashboard**

```bash
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

Log in to Cypress Dashboard:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

Follow instructions to set up your project and copy the **projectId** to your `cypress.config.js`.

---

### 2. **Run Tests in Parallel**

Use the `--record` and `--parallel` flags:

```bash
npx cypress run --record --parallel --key YOUR_PROJECT_RECORD_KEY
```

This will split your test files across available CI machines intelligently.

---

### 3. **CI Config Example (GitHub Actions)**

```yaml
name: Cypress Parallel Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        machine: [1, 2, 3]  # 3 CI containers

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx cypress run --record --parallel --key ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}
```

Set your `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY` in GitHub Secrets for security.

---

## üìà Cypress Dashboard Magic

The Dashboard intelligently distributes specs across machines to optimize speed and record logs, screenshots, and videos per container.

---

## üß† Tips for Better Parallelization

- Keep test files similar in duration (split slow tests)
- Group flaky or long-running specs separately
- Use `--group` flag to organize runs

Example:

```bash
npx cypress run --record --parallel --group ui-tests --key your_key
```

---

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

Parallelizing Cypress tests is a game-changer for teams aiming to speed up feedback loops and ship faster. With just a few tweaks to your config and a free Cypress Dashboard account, you can cut test time by over 60%.
